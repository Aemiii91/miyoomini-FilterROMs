This app adds *Search* to the *Consoles* section of OnionOS and a *Filter* app under *Apps*.

## Search

<img alt="Consoles section" src="screenshots/1.png?raw=true" width="150px"> <img alt="New search" src="screenshots/2.png?raw=true" width="150px"> <img alt="Enter search term" src="screenshots/3.png?raw=true" width="150px"> <img alt="Results" src="screenshots/4.png?raw=true" width="150px"> <img alt="Edit or clear search" src="screenshots/5.png?raw=true" width="150px">

- Go to the *Consoles* section and choose *Search*.
- Press <kbd>A</kbd> again to enter a search term.
- Choose OK or press <kbd>START</kbd> to initiate the search.
- The results can be viewed in a single list with all results or several lists grouped by console.
- Press <kbd>â–²</kbd> (when on the first entry) to go to the search actions.
- Here you can clear the search or choose the `[Search: '...']` option to edit the search term.

**Note:** When the roms are refreshed, the console lists will no longer be cached, and will not be included in the search. To include them, just visit the given console list and it will be scanned and cached.

## Filter

Applying a filter will hide all games in each console list that don't match the selected keywords.

- Open the *Filter* app and apply a filter keyword.
- The app applies the filter and tells you how many games was found for each console.
- Exit the app, and browse your ROM lists to see the filtered results.
- To restore the ROM lists, open the app and clear the filter by pressing X.
