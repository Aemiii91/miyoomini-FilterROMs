# Filter for OnionOS

This is currently only working with Onion, because it's manipulating the *_cache2.db files inside your ROM folders.

## Usage
- Open "Filter" app and apply a filter keyword.
- The app applies the filter and tells you how much was found.
- Exit the app, and browse your ROM lists to see the filtered results.
- To restore the ROM lists, open the app and clear the filter by pressing X.

## Quirks
- When a cache has been manipulated, it's sometimes necessary to scroll a bit to see all list items.
- Another way to clear the filters, is just to refresh the ROM list.

Any feedback is very welcome!
